Objectives:
  -Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
  -Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.

Key Activities:
 1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
 2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
 3.Data Exploration:
     -Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
     -Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.
     -Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
     -Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.
  4.Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots for visualizing the data.

Technologies Used:
 -Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
 -pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
 -numpy: For numerical operations.
 -matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
 -seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

Key Insights:
  1.Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
  2.Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.
  3.Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modeling.
